"""CSC111 Final Report: The National Basketball Associationâ€™s Statistically Best Players Network Module

Description
===============================

This module contains the main network which stores all of the information about the data set including the awards, the
players and the achieved links. In this class, we use methods to add players, awards and achieved links from the data
sets that we found/created. As well, we pass in a networkx.Graph to each of these methods to create a networkx.Graph
which will be used for the visualization of the graph.
