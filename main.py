"""CSC111 Final Report: The National Basketball Associationâ€™s Statistically Best Players Main Module

Description
===============================

This module contains the main functions and variables which will be used throughout the program. This is also the
module which will be run. The module includes a runner function which will load the data sets, create the graphs and
also includes the button system which is used for our GUI. This includes the many button callbacks which are used to
call the other functions from other modules which will be executed when the specific button is pressed. Finally, the
main block is what runs the entire code and holds the main button system loop.
