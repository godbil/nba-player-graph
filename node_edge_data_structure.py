"""CSC111 Final Report: The National Basketball Associationâ€™s Statistically Best Players Node and Edge Module

Description
===============================

This module contains the two node data structures and the edge data structure which is the Award and BasketballPlayer
class and the Achieved class respectively. The Award class holds the name and the amount of points for each award from
our data set. The BasketballPlayer class holds lots of information about the player and finally the Achieved class
has an Award and a BasketballPlayer in it, plus the number of awards of that kind won by the player. Each class has
it's own methods which are used throughout the program. These three classes are used by the network data structure
to keep track of the entire graph.
