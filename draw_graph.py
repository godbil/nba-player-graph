"""CSC111 Final Report: The National Basketball Associationâ€™s Statistically Best Players Visualization Module

Description
===============================

This module is the module which does the visualizations for the graphs using the networkx and matplotlib packages. This
module also does the filtering for the graphs which allows the user to filter the graph to their preference and see
specific things about the graph in more detail. We also have a visualization state which helps the program know which
graph it should plot right now as the class holds the original graph and the current graph. The original graph is used
for resetting the graph for when the user wants to refilter or see the original graph again.
